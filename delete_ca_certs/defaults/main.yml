# Provide a list of CA certs IDs to delete using a format like so:
#   delete_ca_certs:
#     - 'Thawte Primary Root CA'
#     - 'VeriSign Class 1 Public Primary Certification Authority'
#     - 'DeleteMe CA'

# The above IDs show as "label" when viewed using the LMI.

# Chances are the CA certs may need to be loaded into pdsrv - but override as needed
delete_ca_certs_kdb_id: 'pdsrv'
