# Default variables for disabling of authentication policies
# This variable needs to point to your authentication policies as used in aac/configure_authentication_policies
#   Example:
#     authentication_policies:
#       - name: InfoMapAuthenticationName
#         description: test
#         predefined:	false
#         properties:
#           - key: infoMap.JSRule
#             value:	test
#           - key: infoMap.HTMLPage
#             value:	test.html
#         typeName: InfoMapAuthenticationName
#         uri:	urn:ibm:security:authentication:asf:mechanism:test
authentication_policies: []
#
# This variable points to a list names of authentication policies you want to keep enabled.
#   This is meant to include the out of the box policies you need.
#   You do not need to include the "authentication_policies", the 2 lists are combined into 1
#     This mean that if you already have configured the variable authentication_policies elsewhere , as in
#       aac/create_authentication_policies
#     These will be automatically excluded from disabling
#
# Example:
#   whitelist_authentication_policies:
#    - name: MMFA User Presence Authentication
#    - name: Consent Register Device
whitelist_authentication_policies:
  - name: Consent Register Device
  - name: QR Code Login Initiate
  - name: MMFA User Presence Authentication

# Example :
# - hosts: "all"
#  connection: local
#  gather_facts: yes
#  tasks:
#     - name: Disable authentication policies
#       import_role:
#         name: aac/disable_authentication_policies
#       vars       :
#         authentication_policies: "{{ mga_authentication_policies }}"
#         whitelist_authentication_policies:
#           - name: MMFA User Presence Authentication
#       when: mga_authentication_policies is defined
